MultiShapE is an extension of the Shap-E model that enables multilingual text-to-3D generation by integrating a language-agnostic NLP pipeline. While Shap-E produces high-quality 3D implicit functions—such as NeRFs (Neural Radiance Fields) and SDFs (Signed Distance Functions)—based on English prompts, it excludes non-English-speaking users. MultiShapE addresses this by translating prompts from any language into English, thus preserving semantic meaning while maintaining the generative quality of Shap-E.

Key advancements include:
-A 13% improvement in cross-lingual semantic alignment.
-<40 seconds generation time on consumer GPUs.
-Support for a variety of languages and object categories, making it accessible for applications in education, gaming, and digital preservation of culture.

Core Problem:
The paper identifies the challenge of removing the language constraint in 3D generative modeling, ensuring that non-English prompts can produce high-fidelity 3D models without loss of semantic quality or performance.

Objectives

-Translate multilingual input effectively using an NLP pipeline.
-Preserve Shap-E’s architecture and efficiency.
-Ensure performance across low-resource languages.
-Output standard-compatible 3D models.
-Build a scalable and inclusive 3D generation system.

Limitations:

-Multi-object or ultra-detailed scenes remain difficult.
-Translation quality may degrade for underrepresented languages.
-Deployment may be constrained on low-end hardware.
-Bias in training data may affect output fidelity.
